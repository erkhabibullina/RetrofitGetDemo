# RetrofitGetDemo
Here we have developed an app, that simply gets some sophisticated data from a site, that gives us placeholder data in json. We have used a Retrofit library, and OkHttpClient in order to get and handle this data. And then we take this data to the CheckedTextViews like a to-do app, where user can track his progress in achieving his goals.
